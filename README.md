# video-game-distribution-system

Implementation of the project could not be completed because of some issues. For the implementation, I was responsible for the "common functionalities" part stated in the "functionalities.pdf" file. These functionalities were completed. I have also made the blueprint coding of the project and participated in database creation.

*In our project, the additional functionality required under the common functionalities was the "achievements" feature.
